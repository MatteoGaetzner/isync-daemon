# TODOS

- use logging library instead of print()
- proper error handling if something goes wrong with credentials
- output of subprocesses.checkoutput seem to not be complete, fix that
- use approach other for sending to standard input described here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8475290/how-do-i-write-to-a-python-subprocess-stdin>
- integrate this script with the isync repo to have a one-stop solution
